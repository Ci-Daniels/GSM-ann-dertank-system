# GSM-ann-dertank-system
This system is one that monitors the level of water in storage tanks, may monitor progress in levels of river water as well as notify the necessary parties wirelessly on their phones using the GSM module.

# OBJECTIVE
The objective of this project is to develop an automated system for monitoring the level of water in an underground tank with push notification features using the Telegram Bot API.
